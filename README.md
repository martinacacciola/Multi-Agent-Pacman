# Multi-Agent Pacman Capture the Flag
This project presents an approach to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in the context of ”Pacman Capture The Flag”, a multi-player variant of the popular game, where agents control both Pacman and ghosts in coordinated team-based strategies. After thoroughly analyzing the game environment, we guide the search using a selection strategy that balances exploration and exploitation. In this way, we evaluate the states and understand which nodes to expand during the search process. In addition to the MCTS agent, we implement other non-tree search-based agents using heuristic methods and document our comparative analysis, by performing a local tournament to gain insights into the performances.

## Monte Carlo Tree Search
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a decision-making algorithm, consisting of the search of com- binatorial spaces, represented by trees. It explores the state of the actions by simulating a random sampling, then stores the information about what is performed and learns in an intelligent manner which could be the best choice in each subsequent iteration. For this reason, it can be employed in sequential decision-making challenges, such as video games: in these contexts, an agent must make a series of choices, each of which influences the future state of the game. In the application of complex games, MCTS might be particularly effective due to its adaptability to large state spaces with many possible actions, where traditional search algorithms may be computationally expensive or infeasible. The advantages of MCTS include its flexibility and efficiency. It is an anytime algorithm, meaning it can be stopped at any time to return the best solution found so far. This makes it adaptable to real-time constraints, a common feature in video games. MCTS also balances exploration and exploitation during the search process, ensuring that the algorithm does not focus too narrowly on one part of the search space. Furthermore, MCTS does not require a heuristic function but can be enhanced with domain knowledge in various ways, making it versatile and applicable to a wide range of problems.
In the context of the Pacman Capture the Flag Contest, MCTS can be used to guide the actions of both the Pacman and the ghost. The game involves two teams, each controlling a Pacman and a ghost, competing against each other. The state space of the game includes the positions of all characters and the remaining food. The actions include moving the characters in different directions. MCTS can be used to simulate different sequences of actions, evaluate their outcomes, and select the most promising actions to execute. The algorithm can be run separately for the Pacman and the ghost, allowing them to coordinate their actions and work together to beat the opposing team. The flexibility and efficiency of MCTS make it a suitable choice for this complex and dynamic game environment.
