# Multi-Agent-Pacman
This project presents an approach to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in the context of ”Pacman Capture The Flag”, a multi-player variant of the popular game, where agents control both Pacman and ghosts in coordinated team-based strategies. After thoroughly analyzing the game environment, we guide the search using a selection strategy that balances exploration and ex- ploitation. In this way, we evaluate the states and understand which nodes to expand during the search process. In addition to the MCTS agent, we imple- ment other non-tree search-based agents using heuristic methods and document our comparative analysis, by performing a local tournament to gain insights into the performances.
